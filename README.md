# Chicago Crime Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze crime data in Chicago to identify patterns, trends, and hotspots, supporting strategic decision-making for law enforcement. By leveraging historical and recent crime data, we aim to provide actionable insights to improve resource allocation, reduce crime rates, and enhance public safety in Chicago.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains records of reported crimes in Chicago, including:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for each crime incident.
- **Case Number**: Unique case number assigned to each incident.
- **Date**: Date and time when the crime occurred.
- **Block**: Block where the crime occurred.
- **IUCR**: Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting code assigned to the crime type.
- **Primary Type**: Primary classification of the crime.
- **Description**: Detailed description of the crime.
- **Location Description**: Description of the location where the crime occurred.
- **Arrest**: Indicates whether an arrest was made (TRUE/FALSE).
- **Domestic**: Indicates whether the crime was domestic-related (TRUE/FALSE).
- **Beat**: Police beat where the crime occurred.
- **District**: Police district where the crime occurred.
- **Ward**: Ward where the crime occurred.
- **Community Area**: Community area where the crime occurred.
- **FBI Code**: FBI code classification for the crime.
- **X Coordinate**: X coordinate of the crime location.
- **Y Coordinate**: Y coordinate of the crime location.
- **Year**: Year when the crime was reported.
- **Updated On**: Date when the record was last updated.
- **Latitude**: Latitude of the crime location.
- **Longitude**: Longitude of the crime location.
- **Location**: Combined latitude and longitude in a string format.

## Goals and Analysis

### Temporal Analysis

1. **Crime Trends Over Time**: Plot the number of crimes per year to identify trends.
2. **Peak Crime Hours**: Determine the times of day when crimes are most frequently reported.

### Geospatial Analysis

1. **Crime Hotspots**: Identify areas with high concentrations of crimes using heatmaps.
2. **District/Ward Analysis**: Compare crime rates across different districts and wards.

### Crime Type Analysis

1. **Distribution of Crime Types**: Analyze the frequency of different crime types.
2. **Severity Analysis**: Investigate the distribution of severe crimes versus less severe crimes.

### Arrest and Domestic Incident Analysis

1. **Arrest Rates**: Calculate the percentage of crimes that result in an arrest.
2. **Domestic vs. Non-Domestic Crimes**: Compare the characteristics and frequencies of domestic-related incidents versus non-domestic incidents.

### Location-Specific Analysis

1. **Location Description Analysis**: Investigate the most common locations for crimes.
2. **Comparison by Beat and Community Area**: Analyze crime data by beat and community area to identify localized crime patterns.

### Seasonal and Weather Impact

1. **Seasonal Trends**: Examine whether certain types of crimes are more prevalent in specific seasons.

### Repeat Offenders and Recidivism

1. **Repeat Crime Locations**: Identify locations that are repeatedly associated with criminal activity.
2. **Recidivism Rates**: Analyze recidivism rates if data on repeat offenders is available.

### Predictive Modeling and Risk Assessment

1. **Predictive Analysis**: Develop models to predict future crime incidents based on historical data, time, location, and other relevant factors.
2. **Risk Assessment**: Assess the risk of different areas and times for specific types of crimes to help in resource allocation for law enforcement.

### Visualization and Reporting

1. **Interactive Dashboards**: Create interactive dashboards to dynamically visualize and explore the data.
2. **Detailed Crime Reports**: Generate detailed reports highlighting key trends, hotspots, and critical insights.
